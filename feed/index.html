<p style="text-align: left;">4. How we collect your personal data</p>

&#x200d;<br />
a) fill out any forms on our website;<br />

b) occasionally we will use publicly available information about you from publicly available sources (e.g., media, online registers and directories) and websites for enhanced due diligence checks, security searches and other purposes related to client due diligence processes;<br />
c) we may receive personal data from a third party which is connected to you or is dealing with us, for example, business partners, sub–contractors, service providers, merchants and etc.;<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">5. Our identification tools<br />
In order to perform your identity verification, we use the services provided by our partner ”Sumsub” (hereinafter – ”Sumsub”). The Service Provider takes the photo images or video recordings of your face and your ID document that you provide through a dedicated website using the camera. For more information on ”Sumsub” please read their Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#x200d;“Sumsub” solution is used for comparing live photographic data or video record of your and your ID document, to comply with legal obligations (e.g., implementation of the obligations under the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing of the Republic of Singapore and other fraud and crime prevention purposes) and risk management obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The result of the face similarity (match or mismatch) will be retained for as long as it is necessary to carry out verification and for the period required by anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We ensure that your face similarity check is a process of comparing data acquired at the time of verification, i.e., this is a one-time user authorization by comparing person’s photos to each other. Your facial template is not created, recorded or stored. It is not possible to regenerate the raw data from retained information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using “Sumsub” services, personal data is used for your identification, since “Sumsub” verifies the identity of the person in the identity document and the person captured in the photo. This process shall allow us to verify your identity more precisely and make the process quicker and easier to execute.
